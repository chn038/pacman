# bug:

ghost movement seems kinda random (perfect)

# current difficulty:

Fine:
    If one's lucky and patient, one can pass it.

---

# not implemented:

- setting screen
    - volume
    - ghost count
    - bgm?
    - scary?
- scoreboard

---

# scary one:

I think it's already scary though.
- speed up?
- broken effect?
- use a large single map instead

goal:
 clear the map ->
 change to the long map ->
 get to the end (maybe jumpscare?)

---

# multi player?
