# bug:

ghost movement seems kinda random (perfect)
- facing position is wrong

# description

Try to save power beans for later.

Type: Inky
    Mostly the ghosts you'll meet are them, they aren't really aware of you and most of the time won't come to you.
    If you having trouble dealing with them, well, you're unlucky.
Type: Pinky
    They are a bit more cautious, and there are less of them too.
    Maybe you won't want to be close to them.
Type: Clyde
    They are dangerous and will come to you most of the time.
    If you can't runaway, try to face them.
Type: Blinky
    They are deadly, run as fast as you can.
